# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: ['main']

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
